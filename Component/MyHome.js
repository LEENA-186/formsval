            How much money do you get from a reverse mortgage?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            The amount of money you can borrow depends on how much home equity
            you have available. You typically cannot use more than 80% of your
            home's equity based on its appraised value. As of 2018, the maximum
            amount anyone can be paid from a reverse mortgage is $679,650.
            However, most people will be paid much less.

            Lenders will assess the personal loan amount according to your
            monthly salary of INR 23,000. With this income, you can pay an EMI
            of around 50 percent of your monthly income which is INR 11,500.
            Based on this, you can get a maximum loan of INR 4 lakh for a period
            of 5 years at an interest rate of 14 percent per annum.
